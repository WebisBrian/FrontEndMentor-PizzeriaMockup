# FrontEndMentor-PizzeriaMockup

Implementation of a project using HTML and CSS. The mockup involves the layout of a pizzeria website, designed to be responsive with:

- a burger menu
- layout design using FlexBox
- the need to adapt images according to the specified design
- the creation of a form

Currently, there is no JavaScript implementation.

## My Process:

### Built with:

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- VSC

### What I Learned:

With each new project, positioning with Flexbox becomes easier. Choosing selectors, in particular, posed a significant challenge, always with the goal of maintaining clean code and simplifying development.

### Continued Development:

In the future, I plan to incorporate JavaScript into these projects (to be covered next in my training) to make them more dynamic.

### Useful Resources:

- W3 Schools for media queries
- ChatGPT: not extensively used, but it helped me explore other development possibilities
- CSS Generator: for shadows
